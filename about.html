            Hi! My name is Arjane Lor you may call me Jana. I love <i class="fas fa-book"></i>
             reading books, <i class="fas fa-tv"></i> watching anime and <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> 
             programming. I studied Psychology in Liceo De Cagayan University. For my previous job I worked 
             in Business Processing Outsourcing for 3 years,I also tried working as an ESL Teacher (English 
             as Secondary Language) for 6 months. In my journey it was truly amazing and wonderful however 
             for the love of techonology I started focusing on my passion which is programming  so I joined 
             Zuitt Coding Bootcamp to re-learn my lost knowledge in programming I only have basic programming
              knowledge which I learned during highschool years, I didn't pursue programming, as my father 
              wish a different path for me, however as I started working I still went back to what I truly 
              love which is technology.
